# E-Commerce Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using SQL

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Brazilian e-commerce public dataset by **Olist** using **SQL** and **Python**. The analysis is done by importing data into a SQLite database and running complex SQL queries to extract insights.

## 📦 Dataset

The data used is from the [Olist E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), which includes information about:

- Products
- Reviews
- Payments
- Geolocation
- Product category translations

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python**
- **SQLite (via sqlite3 module)**
- **Pandas**

- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📌 Key Analyses Performed
- Orders placed and delivered over time
- Distribution of review scores (5-star analysis)
- Customer engagement by month/year
- Payments: Average order value and payment methods
- Product popularity by category
- Seller performance metrics

## 📈 Sample Queries and Visuals
- % of orders with 5-star reviews in Jan 2018
